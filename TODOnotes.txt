TODO: work on saving single book to database, if successful, we can do it in for loop

Notes (can leave notes here detailing what you did):
I accessed necessary data and put them into variables. required mongoose and Book model to attempt to save single book to db. 
That attempt is commented out; what is not commented out is for loop that we made last night along with the necessary data/variables



extra code:

  


peyton - in user model.js i added bcrypt and a custom function to check if password is correct.  I plan to then use that check inside of resolvers.
