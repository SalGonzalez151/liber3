TODO: 
- BUILD UP SEARCH FEATURE LOGIC: so when user types in search bar, they can search a book by title or author

- MAKE A RATING: have a user be able to rate a book

- COMMENT: have a user be able to comment on a book

- CREATE A USER THAT IS AN ADMIN: figure out how to create a user that is an admin instead of user, from there, probably need to build functionality exclusive to admins only (probably by queries and mutations)

- NAV MENU - change background color of dropdown menu to a slightly lighter than dark purple we have for color scheme; make the nav menu button's background color also slightly lighter than the dark purple we have been using

=============================================

NOTES (can leave notes here detailing what you did):

General notes: 

    always git pull origin main when you get on and before you code to avoid git conflicts as much as possible

    MyLibrary: is user's profile; MyBookshelf: will be saved books

    front end: when making queries and mutations, dont just select all fields. Pay attention to what information you will be returning, because some are unnecessary.
    For example, when making the CREATE_USER mutation, i didn't select keptBooks, because they won't have any, so we don't need to retrieve or return that field for this mutation.


    ===================================================
