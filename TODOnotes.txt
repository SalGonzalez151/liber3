TODO: 
- figure out how to create a user that is an admin instead of user, from there, probably need to build functionality exclusive to admins only (probably by queries and mutations)

- Got a few errors that say couldnt fetch a whole page (i saw page 15 and 24, surely a few more that i couldnt notice since the data moves so fast in terminal). i npm run developed again because I noticed that if we are getting the dup errors, that maybe means we are fetching all over again, so maybe the page errors could be corrected since less new data is being put in. It did not work, because in compass we are still only at 573 documents in the books collection. Since we expected 800 books to be fetched, this means we are missing 227, meaning thats about 7 pages that were not fetched.



NOTES (can leave notes here detailing what you did):

General notes: 
    front end: when making queries and mutations, dont just select all fields. Pay attention to what information you will be returning, because some are unnecessary.
    For example, when making the CREATE_USER mutation, i didn't select keptBooks, because they won't have any, so we don't need to retrieve or return that field for this mutation.

from Ryan: 
    

from Peyton : 
        in the home component i am going to render a small carousel to go at the top to display so images purley for look

        under this we can contunie with the home page the way it was layed up with the 5 books and whatever else we think of, just thought this addition added a professionally look.

        i updated the nav bar to have a search bar and be responsive using material ui

        inside of the signup that pasha made i set up so if the user clicks sign up they will now be taken to the signup sal created

from Sal :
added apollo code to main.jsx and app.jsx. Also put a temporary signup form on the signup page. Can be modified.
started on bookReader page but figured we could wait until Ryan gets the images showing up because then the data should be the same also. Started to work on login/modal work
EXTRA CODE:
